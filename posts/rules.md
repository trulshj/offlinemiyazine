# APPLICATION GUIDELINES

### GENERAL APPLICATION GUIDELINES

* ➡ Applicants should be at **least 13 years old** at the point of applying.

* ➡ Make sure all links submitted are accessible. When submitting a Google Drive file/folder, don't forget to switch the permissions to **"Anyone with the link can view"**. We will **not** be contacting an applicant due to broken links. To be sure your links work, try entering the URL in incognito mode before submitting.

* ➡ Due to the nature of the zine being purely SFW and having a minor mod on board, all samples should be **SFW**. Submitting any NSFW samples will result in immediate disqualification.

* ➡ Previous zine experience is **not** required. We will choose contributors solely based on their skills and how well they can fit into the theme of the zine.
Failure to adhere to the guidelines will result in disqualification.

* ➡ Applicants are allowed to submit applications for multiple roles and while we will prioritize accepting as many people as possible, we may also accept someone into multiple positions if we need to fill spots.

### PAGE ARTIST

* ➡ Please provide **three** samples with simple-complex backgrounds (anything other than backgrounds with single colors or gradients).

* ➡ A link to a portfolio (Google Drive, social media, website, etc.) will be asked for but it will be completely optional.

* ➡ Sample(s) featuring Chinen Miya is not required but highly encouraged.

### MERCH ARTISTS

* ➡ Please provide three samples of any types of merch/products (ie. icons, wallpapers, emotes, stickers, prints, charms, etc).
